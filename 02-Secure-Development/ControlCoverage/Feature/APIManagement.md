<tr><td><b>All users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</b><br/>Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.</td><td>Medium</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><b>Metric alert rules must be configured for critical actions on API Management service</b><br/>Metric alert for occurrence of unauthorized gateway requests help the admin to identify security breach attempts.</td><td>Medium</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><b>Diagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days</b><br/>Logs should be retained for a long enough period so that activity trail can be recreated when investigations are required in the event of an incident or a compromise. A period of 1 year is typical for several compliance requirements as well.</td><td>Medium</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><b>Backend API must only be accessible over HTTPS via API Management service</b><br/>Use of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer eavesdropping attacks.</td><td>High</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><b>API Management service instance should be backed up periodically</b><br/>The service 'backup and restore' feature provides facility to recover from availability problems affecting the region where your API Management service is hosted.</td><td>Medium</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><b>Encryption of Named Values must be enabled when storing sensitive data</b><br/>Encrypted Named Values are stored securely by the Azure platform.</td><td>High</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><b>API Management REST API must be disabled and it is recommended to use ARM based REST API</b><br/>The credentials used to access API Management REST API provide admin-level access without support for role-based access control and without recording audit logs. For better security it is recommended to make calls through the ARM-based REST API.</td><td>High</td><td>Yes</td></tr></table>
