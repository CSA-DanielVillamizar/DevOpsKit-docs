-----------------------------------------------------------------
## Downloading Script
1.	Please download the PowerShell script from https://azsdkdataoss.blob.core.windows.net/azsdk-configurations/recmnds/Install-CAForCluster.ps1.
2.	Open and run the downloaded script in PowerShell ISE.

## Prerequisites
1.	For every cluster type, we assume the required cluster is already created in your subscription. 
2.	You may need to pass additional details like cluster location (for Databricks) so note it down while creating the resource to keep it handy. 
3.	All scripts use Azure Powershell. If you donâ€™t have it installed please visit: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest  
4.	For Kubernetes, additionally you will need to install `kubectl`. Run the following command after installing Azure PowerShell
    ```PowerShell
    az aks install-cli
    ```

## Setting up HDInsight

1. Install Continuous Assurance for HDInsight cluster using the command:

    ```PowerShell
    $lastJobPod = kubectl get pods --namespace azsk-scanner -o jsonpath='{.items[-1:].metadata.name}' 
    Kubectl logs $lastJobPod --namespace azsk-scanner
    ```
    ![AKS-Step2](../Images/AKS-Step2.png)

3.	To view details like CA job schedule, last schedule run the below command


    ```PowerShell
    kubectl get cronjob azsk-ca-job --namespace azsk-scanner
    ```
    ![AKS-Step3](../Images/AKS-Step3.png)

4. To view logs of any specific job

    a. List all the pods created by AzSK CA job using below command

    ```PowerShell
        kubectl get cronjob azsk-ca-job --namespace azsk-scanner
     ```

    ![AKS-Step4a](../Images/AKS-Step4a.png)
