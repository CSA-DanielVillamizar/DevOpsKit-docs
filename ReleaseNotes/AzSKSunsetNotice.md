# AzSK Sunset Notice

## After more than 4 years of development, the PowerShell/Automation-based DevOps Kit (AzSK) is being phased out through FY21.To continue to have aggregate visibility to our cloud environment security, we are migrating to a more scalable and robust solution called Azure Tenant Security (AzTS) scanner which is based on Azure Functions and a central scan model supported via a management group level managed identity with Reader access to scanned subscriptions. It is also designed to accelerate our migration to native Azure capabilities (policy, ASC, management groups, ARG, etc.).
## At CSEO, we plan to phase out AzSK-based Continuous Assurance completely during Q3-FY21 and our other dependencies on AzSK (ARM Checker, CICD extensions, etc.) during Q4-FY21. We will support important bug fixes in AzSK till end of FY21 however, new security controls will be added only to AzTS going forward.
## The new solution, AzTS, is available atÂ https://aka.ms/devopskit/tss. We have been using it to scan close to 100K subscriptions in our environment every day. 
As promised, we will continue to share our internal approach and migration path towards native Azure capabilities. We believe AzTS gets us a step closer to that. If you have a dependency on AzSK, please consider either migrating to AzTS or switching using an approach based on Azure policy, management groups, ASC, etc.
