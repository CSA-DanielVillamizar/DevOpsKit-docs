> The Secure DevOps Kit for Azure (AzSK) was created by the Core Services Engineering & Operations (CSEO) division at Microsoft, to help accelerate Microsoft IT's adoption of Azure. We have shared AzSK and its documentation with the community to provide guidance for rapidly scanning, deploying and operationalizing cloud resources, across the different stages of DevOps, while maintaining controls on security and governance.
AzSK is not an official Microsoft product â€“ rather an attempt to share Microsoft CSEO's best practices with the community..

# Secure Azure DevOps (VSTS) -Preview

AzSK for Azure DevOps performs security scanning for core areas of Azure DevOps/VSTS like Organization, Projects, Users, Connections, Pipelines (Build & Release). 


## Installation Guide

>**Pre-requisites**:
> - PowerShell 5.0 or higher. 

1. First verify that prerequisites are already installed:  
    Ensure that you have PowerShell version 5.0 or higher by typing **$PSVersionTable** in the PowerShell ISE console window and looking at the PSVersion in the output as shown below.) 
 If the PSVersion is older than 5.0, update PowerShell from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616).  
   ![PowerShell Version](../Images/00_PS_Version.PNG)   

2. Install the Secure DevOps Kit for Azure DevOps (AzSK.AzureDevOps) PS module:  
	  
```PowerShell
  Install-Module AzSK.AzureDevOps -Scope CurrentUser
```

Note: 

You may need to use `-AllowClobber` and `-Force` options with the Install-Module command 
above if you have a different version of same modules installed on your machine.


## Scan your Azure DevOps resources

Run the command below after replacing `<OrganizationName>` with your Azure DevOps Org Name 
and `<PRJ1, PRJ2, ..`> with a comma-separated list of project names where your Azure DevOps resources are hosted.
You will get Organization name from vsts url e.g. http://samplevstsorg.visualstudio.com. In this 'samplevstsorg' is Org name.

```PowerShell
Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "<PRJ1, PRJ2,...etc.>"
```

Command also supports other parameters of filtering resources.
For instance, you can also make use of the 'BuildNames','ReleaseNames' to filter specific resource

```PowerShell

#Scan Organization
Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>"

#San Organization and Project
Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "<PRJ1,PRJ2,etc>" 

#Scan Org, project and Builds
Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -BuildNames "<BLD1, BLD2,...etc.>" 

#Scan Org, project and releases
Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -ReleaseNames "<RLS1, RLS2,...etc.>" 

#Scan Org, project, all builds and releases
Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -BuildNames "*" -ReleaseNames "*" 

#Scan all supported artifacts
Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ScanAllArtifacts
```


Similar to Azure AzSK SVT scan, outcome of the analysis is printed on the console during SVT execution and a CSV and LOG files are 
also generated for subsequent use.

The CSV file and LOG file are generated under a Org-specific sub-folder in the folder  
*%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\AzSK.AzureDevOpsLogs\Org_[yourOrganizationName]*  
E.g.  
C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Azure.DevOpsLogs\Org_[yourOrganizationName]\20181218_103136_GADS

Refer [doc](../02-Secure-Development#understand-the-scan-reports) for understanding the scan report and [link](./ControlCoverage) for current control coverage for Azure DevOps
